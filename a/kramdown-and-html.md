Hey there and welcome to LUMT!

In this tutorial (well it kinda isn't a tutorial) we will cover on how to include HTML in your `.md` files when you use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). When you embed HTML in your Markdown (or in this case [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) wich is the default Markdown renderer used by Jekyll) magic happens, e.g. you can add copy buttons for your code blocks (yeah those aren't built in in most themes) or embed youtube videos.
