### I appreciate your work **so** much, what can I do to support you and LUMT?
LUMT is a non-profit project, wich means that I don't want to make any money with it while also trying to not lose any. Although you can still support me by doing one or multiple things on this list:
- Give this repository a star on [GitHub](https;//github.com/queizen30/lumt)
- Follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Queizenn30)
- [Contribute](/a/contribute) to LUMT
    - Create a request for a new item
    - Add a search bar (this would be **so awesome**)
    - Add a blog post
    - Something other
- Become a [Supporter](/a/become-supporter)
- If you mind spending a few dollars
    - Buy a domain for LUMT (See [here](/a/buy-lumt-a-domain))

### How do you manage this site?
I use GitHub Pages for hosting, and a free domain for the domain. See [this blog article](/a/how-does-lumt-work).

### What's the purpose of LUMT?
It's defenitly not the best user experience. LUMT is a useful resource if you know how to use it. Instead of adding multiple tools from one website into LUMT, I just add the entire website. You'll have to find the use of the website yourself.
Basicly, it's just *finding* the websites and not being the *most useful* tool for users. (Although thats the second purpose)

### How do you find all the tools?
Mostly browing through reddit, or scrolling on Google until I think I should have reached the end by now. (Spoiler: I never do.)
Sometimes I also find myself browsing through old dusty forum articles. (Did you know PlanetMinecraft has [a forum](https://www.planetminecraft.com/forums/toc/)?)
